# Alzheimer-Detection

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for Alzheimer's disease detection. The dataset consists of 2D axial brain images extracted from the ADNI baseline dataset, with three classes: AD (Alzheimer's Disease), CI (Mild Cognitive Impaired), and CN (Common Normal) subjects. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is created and trained using the training data. The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, specificity, and AUC-ROC.
